"""A simple script to create nebula outlines catalog for several software.

The script will read all the files in the 'objects' directory
and outputs a single file with simplified objects outlines.

If you want to increase objects shape definition you can modify the
shape_precision value, but be aware that this will also
increase the output file size.
