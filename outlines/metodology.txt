These object outlines are generated using Aladin Sky Atlas from the Centre de Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg and a small Python script which make use of shapely module to reduce the points.

We start by using the "draw" function in Aladin Desktop to draw the contour of an object. We use the default DSS2 Color layer, usually playing with histogram and reversing the image to get a better idea of the object shape. There are no fixed settings for this, it's highly subjective to the user to find optimal settings.
Then we export the plane in a subdirectory named 'objects' with an appropriate name in the form '[IC/NGC][dddd].txt'.

Those object files have a lot of points due to the high pecision of the coordinates being saved, but we really don't need that amount of information, so we use the 'shape.py' script to simplify the shape of the object.
Inside the script there's the 'shape_precision' variable, which by default is set to 0.002. Lowering that value will produce higher precision outlines, but with an increase of the size of the ouptut catalog.

WIP: the 'shape' script currently outputs a catalog which fits the needs of Skychart Catgen (we also provide a project file for that). The next step will be to add a script for Stellarium, or to make the base script "modular", so that it can be extended to fit for different software.
